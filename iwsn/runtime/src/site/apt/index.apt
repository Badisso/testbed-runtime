TR :: Runtime

  <<WHAT IS 'Testbed Runtime'?>>

  The Testbed Runtime creates an overlay network for easy node addressing
and message exchange independent from the actual underlying network connections.
Nodes are addressed using URN.

  This allows for later inclusion of additional networking underlays such as
peer-to-peer systems.
