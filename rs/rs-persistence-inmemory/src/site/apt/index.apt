  <<WHAT IS 'RS Persistence In-Memory'>>

  The RS Persistence In-Memory allows you to use the
Reservation System with a non-persistent in-memory data storage. The configuration happens
through a properties-file. There is a sample configuration file located in the configs subfolder including a small
description of possible properties and their meanings.
