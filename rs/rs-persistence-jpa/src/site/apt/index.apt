  <<WHAT IS 'RS Persistence JPA'>>

  The RS Persistence JPA is the implementation of the
{{{http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/persistence.jsp}Java Persistence API}}. It allows you to use the
Reservation System with a configurable persistent Database storage. The configuration happens
through a properties-file. There is a sample configuration file located in the configs subfolder including a small
description of possible properties and their meanings.
