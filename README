  Testbed Runtime release 0.5.1

WHAT IS 'TESTBED RUNTIME'?
 
  The Testbed Runtime is a set of programs that together form a wireless sensor networks
  testbed infrastructure. It implements the APIs defined by the european research project
  WISEBED [1], namely RS (Reservation System), SNAA (Sensor Network Authentication and
  Authorization) and iWSN (Wireless Sensor Network API).

BUILDING

  Testbed Runtime is based on the Apache Maven 2 [2] build system. Clone the project and
  simply run 'mvn package' or 'mvn install' for building.

MODULES

  Testbed Runtime delivers a set of modules that can be independently used from each
  other (as long as dependencies are met). A description of the individual modules here
  is yet to be done, stay tuned. 

The project is made open-source under the terms of the BSD license, was created and is
maintained by the Institute of Telematics, University of Luebeck, Germany.
