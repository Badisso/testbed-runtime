BUILDING

  SNAA is based on the Apache Maven 2 [2] build system.
  Simply run 'mvn package' or 'mvn install' for building the appropriate module.

RUNNING

  For executing the RS in a commandline environment you'll find a module called
  'TR :: SNAA Commandline Client' in its subfolder 'snaa-cmdline-client'
  and a module called 'TR :: SNAA Commandline Server' in its subfolder 'snaa-cmdline-server'.
  Just delegate to the appropriate subfolder and call 'mvn package' or 'mvn install'.
  Afterwards you'll find the executable jar in the target directory.

    TR :: SNAA Commandline Client:
      Calling the jar file there are 9 different options:
        -a,--action <arg>          Action string for authorization operation, defaults to: reserve
        -h,--help                  Help output
        -l,--url <arg>             URL of the SNAA, defaults to http://127.0.0.1:8080/snaa/dummy1
        -o,--operation <arg>       Operation to perform, possible values: [authenticate, authorize]

        -x,--urnprefix <arg>       URN Prefix, defaults to urn:wisebed:dummy

    TR :: SNAA Commandline Server:
      Calling the jar file there are 3 different options:
        -f,--file <arg>   The properties file
        -h,--help         Help output
        -v,--verbose      Verbose logging output

      Properties file:
        Setting up your SNAA Server environment you need to specify a configuration file. There is a sample
        configuration file located in the configs subfolder of the 'SNAA Commandline Server' module including
        a small description of possible properties and their meanings.

      For using your properties file simply add it to the commandline input, e.g. for using the current
      snapshot with the sample-properties file in the configs-folder just call
       'java -jar target/tr.snaa-cmdline-server-0.5.2-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar -f configs/sample.properties'
