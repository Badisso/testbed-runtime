TR :: SNAA Dummy

  <<WHAT IS 'SNAA Dummy'>>

  The Dummy SNAA system returns random secret authentication keys for each input to authenticate and
returns true for each call to authorize.

  It is therefore most useful for temporary lab installations which are not publicly accessible or for testing.
